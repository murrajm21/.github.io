<H1>About Me</H1>
Hello, I am <b>Jayden Murray</b>, and I am a sophomore. I like things such as music, cars, airplanes, and antiques. 
I reallly am interested in things pertaining to Soviet History, which is why I found Professor Kruse's Father-In-Law's
presentation so interesting. I really like IT-105 so far. One reason for this is because Professor Kruse is so fun to 
have as a professor, and the other reason is that I find HTML coding interesting. I have always liked playing with 
inspect element, so this is <u>very fun!</u> I was frustrated with GitHub at first, and then I remembered that people use
GitHub for coding projects with WiFi capabilites, which made me realize the purpose (and advantage) of being able to 
run HTML code from a website. I have watched tons of Youtube videos utilizing GitHub, and taking this class has 
helped me to better understand what exactly they're doing in their videos.

<H2>My Future Plans</H2>
I have a few plans for the future which I am excited about. Firstly, I hope to be studying abroad in Kyrgyzstan
both this Summer and the next school year, which is going to be very interesting. After I study abroad, I hope to 
get a job at Sun Motor Cars, which is exciting since that is owned by a Juniata Alum! With this, I hope to save up 
money so that I can have a good start after College. I already work at a Car show over the Summer, so I have some 
saved, but it is always better to have more. College loans are going to be <u>expensive</u>, but I do not regret it one bit,
especially considering I am planning to be able to do what I came here to do. I am very lucky to have such good
friends, which makes the college experience so much better. I hope that in the future, I am able to stay close and 
connected with all of them, as that would be really exciting.

<H3>Most Recent Book I Have Read</H3>
The most recent book I have read is <i>Unknown Soldiers</i> by Neil Hanson. I read this book for my history class, 
<b>HS 200</b>. It is about 3 different soldiers of 3 different countries (Germany, England, and the US), who each
fight (and die) in The Great War. The book includes their actual letters from their family members, which is <u>very
interesting!</u> So far I like it, although it is quite a long book to read. I do not get the change to read too often
so I am happy when I have the chance. <br>
